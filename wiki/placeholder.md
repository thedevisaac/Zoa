This article lists all the **placeholder names** used in the project, until eventually in-world names are developed. These names refer to many different types of things, such as planets, geographical features, and cultures. All placeholder names link here.

# Astronomical Bodies
Until a better name is developed, the name for the Zoan star system (and the star itself) will be just "**The Zoan System**" or "**The Zoan Star System**" with word-initial capitals, the star will be called just "**The Star**" or "**Zoa's sun**", and the planets will be referred to as "**b**", "**c**", "**e**", "**F**", "**G**", and "**H**" (planet "d" is Zoa itself).

An important note here is that these names are Great Sea-centric because all of the original maps of Zoa were centered on the great sea. The names are displayed on the following map:
